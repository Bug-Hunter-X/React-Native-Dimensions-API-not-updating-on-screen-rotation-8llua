This error occurs when using the `Dimensions` API in React Native to get screen dimensions, especially within a component that renders multiple times.  The `Dimensions.get('window')` method doesn't update automatically when the screen orientation changes, leading to stale dimensions being used in layout calculations, resulting in unexpected rendering issues or misalignment of elements.
